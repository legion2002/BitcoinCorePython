# BitcoinCorePython
In this repository I work on a modified version of the bitcoin core pyflo. The goal is to cross verify message signatures between pyflo and ranchi mall standard operations.

Repositories Cloned for the Project -

PyBTC - https://github.com/bitaps-com/pybtc

PyFLO by RanchiMallFLO - https://github.com/ranchimall/pyflo

KeySharing by RanchiMallFLO

Standard Operations - https://github.com/ranchimall/Standard_Operations

Task - 
The PyFLO library is a fork of PyBTC updated for use on the FLO Blockchain.

Standard Operations, is written in JavaScript and produces an ECDSA Signature on the secp256k1 curve.

The task is to convert the signature functions in the PyFLO library so that they can be crossverified with standard operations
